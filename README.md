# LogisticRegression-pyspark
This code focuses on building a logistic regression model
from scratch using PySpark and Jupyter Notebook.Also, some important functions 
like filter,group by and so like have been mentioned in this code. At first,
some of statistical and mentioned functioned were used and then the model was built.
The dataset that we are going to use for this example is a dummy dataset
and contains a total of 20,000 rows and 6 columns. We have to use 5 input
variables to predict the target class using the logistic regression model.
This dataset contains information regarding online users of a retail sports
merchandise website. The data captures the country of user, platform
used, age, repeat visitor or first-time visitor, and the number of web
pages viewed on the website. It also has the information if the customer
ultimately bought the product or not (conversion status).
